# Route Group Optimization

To further optimize your bundle size, consider organizing your app into route groups:

1. Create a folder structure like this:
   - app/(marketing)/page.tsx (homepage)
   - app/(marketing)/about/page.tsx
   - app/(marketing)/services/page.tsx
   - app/(marketing)/portfolio/page.tsx
   - app/(marketing)/blog/page.tsx
   - app/(marketing)/layout.tsx (shared layout for marketing pages)
   
   - app/(app)/contact/page.tsx (client component with form)
   - app/(app)/layout.tsx (minimal layout for app pages)

2. This helps Next.js optimize the bundle by:
   - Grouping related pages together
   - Allowing different layouts for different sections
   - Reducing the amount of JavaScript loaded for each route

3. To implement this:
   - Create the folders
   - Move your existing pages into these folders
   - Create separate layouts for each group
